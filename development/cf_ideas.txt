* extend sockets day 1 to go more in-depth on various types/families/protocols
* day 1 exercise is writing a packet-sniffer in python, then using it to look
  at network traffic.

* day two of sockets then implements simple echo server/client in TCP and a
  second one in UDP.

* day three discuss protocols, implement HTTP server using echo server base

* day four, discuss strategies for parallelism, incorporate select into the
  http server



six weeks, 24 sessions:

Week 1: Python Review/Update (including editor/environment, testing)
Week 2: Python Networking, low-level (sockets, protocols, communications)
Week 3: APIs and Libraries (consuming and creating data on and off-line)
Week 4: Networking Project...??? (build some sort of simple wsgi app)

Week 5: Flask and microframeworks (dbapi2, sqlalchemy)
Week 6: Django and full-stack frameworks (django ORM)
Week 7: Traversal, ZODB, Pyramid
Week 8: Web Project (pick a framework and build something non-trivial)

incorporate deployment strategies and ci integration along the way.





* Write a packet-sniffer in python, implement at least IP and TCP protocols,
make friendly output
