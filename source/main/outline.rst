Course Outline
==============

Each week will have in-class lectures, lab time, and lightning talks.  There
will be recommended reading, additional reading for the curious, and an 
assignment to be completed.

Week 1 - Introduction and Sockets
---------------------------------

In this class, we will discuss the fundamental concepts and structures that
underly the internet and networked computing. We will learn about the TCP/IP
stack (Internet Protocol Suite) and gain insight into how that model is
manifested in real life. We will learn about sockets and how to use them to
communicate between processes on a single machine or across a network.

Our class laboratory will focus on creating a small server-client program that
demonstrates the use of sockets. We will install the server on our Virtual
Machines, and accomplish our first networked communication.

The class assignment will focus on extending our use of sockets to support a
more complex use-case.
