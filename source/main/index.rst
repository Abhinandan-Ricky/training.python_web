Minutiae
--------

:Overview:

    This five day workshop emphasizes network-based programming and Web
    applications, how they work and how to program them in Python. Explore the
    underlying principles and their expression in the Python libraries. Learn
    contrasting approaches in creating applications: programming with the
    low-level libraries versus using highly integrated frameworks


:Prerequisites:

    To attend this workshop you should have a working knowledge of the basic
    syntax and structures of the Python programming language. You will also
    need to be comfortable working at the command line to navigate a file
    system, create and delete files, and execute commands. Finally, you should
    have some basic knowledge of HTML.


:Requirements:

    This workshop does not provide a computer laboratory. You will have to
    have a portable computer in order to participate. Network access, both
    wired and wireless, will be provided, but you will need to know how to
    operate the network settings for your computer.

    Your computer must have Python version 2.6 or 2.7 installed. No
    additional libraries will be required, but we will be installing some as
    the workshop progresses.


:What to Expect:

    This one-week course will cover the fundamental concepts of networked
    programming in Python. You'll learn everything, starting from the
    protocols that power the internet and the sockets that enable
    communications between processes and machines, right up to the full-stack
    frameworks that enable developers to build rich applications efficiently.

    Along the way, you'll learn through a combination of lecture and
    activity. Historical information will be combined with exercises designed
    to help you learn the Pythonic way to create programs that interact with
    each-other across networks. Each module will include reading lists for
    more information and ideas for projects you can use to help cement the
    lessons you learn after the the class is over.

    **This class is** intended to give students a solid grounding in the
    fundamental underpinnings of network programming. In addition, you will
    gain a basic understanding of a broad range of Pythonic tools and learn to
    choose the right tool for a given task.

    **This class is not** an in-depth course in any single Python web
    framework. As the intention is to give you evaluative tools for selecting
    the right framework for your task, you will learn basic usage for the
    frameworks covered as well as the choices and compromises that shape them.
